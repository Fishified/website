    <h2> How to configure a <i>cmd</i> command prompt in Windows 10 to run Telemac-Mascaret: </h2>

    <p class="main">
        Follow the steps below if for some reason the command prompt that was installed on your Desktop (<i>Telemac_v8p0.exe</i>) using the <i>opentelemac-mascaret</i> automatic installer dissappears or gets accidentally erased.
    </p>


    <ol>

        <li class="blog" > Right-click on an empty spot on your Desktop. </li> 

        <li class="blog">  Select <i>New->Shortcut.</i>  </li>  
        
        <li class="blog"> When prompted for "Type the location of the item", enter:  <i>C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /F:ON /E:ON /V:ON /K set SYSTELCFG=C:\opentelemac-mascaret\v8p0\configs\systel_v8p0.cfg</i>, then click on "ok".</li>

        <li class="blog">
            When prompted, type a distinct name to help you remember what the shortcut is for (e.g., Telemac_v8p0.exe). 
        </li>

        <li class="blog">
            Then add an entry for <i>C:\opentelemac-mascaret\v8p0\scripts\python27</i> to your <u><i>user's</i></u> Path variable in Environment Variables (search for Environment Variables in the Start bar).
        </li>

        <li class="blog">
            After, click on the newly created short-cut and navigate to a folder containing a working Telemac case file (e.g. by typing this in the commandline: <i> cd C:\opentelemac-mascaret\v8p0\examples\telemac2d\hydraulic_jump</i>) and then type <i>telemac2d.py t2d_hydraulic_jump_v1p0.cas</i> to see if everything works correctly.
        </li>

        <li class="blog">
            An extra (recommended) optional step is to configure the newly created short-cut to open by default in a directory of your choosing. To do this, right-click on the newly created shortcut and type the path to a directory of your choice (e.g., <i>C:/Users/YourUserName/Desktop/YourTelemacSimulationFolderName</i>). The shortcut will open to this folder each time you click on it, allowing you to save the time and annoyance of having to navigate to it each time.  
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="main">
        Troubleshooting: If you do the above steps and you get an error that saves telemac2d.py is not recongnized as an internal or external program, check that you do not have <i>C:\opentelemac-mascaret\python27</I> in your User Path. I was troubleshooting my opentelemac-mascaret installation a while back and accidently left C:\opentelemac-mascaret\python27 in my path. I was getting above mentioned error until I removed C:\opentelemac-mascaret\python27 from my path.
