Effect of Fish Baffles on the Hydraulic Roughness of Slip-Lined Culverts. Journal of Hydraulic Engineering (ASCE), 141(1), 04014065. </p>

<p class="main"> This modified excerpt taken from my Phd thesis provides a clear explanation of the problems related to the practice of sliplining from both a fish passage and practical engineering perspective.<p>    
    <I>
    <p class="main">
        Culverts are engineered hydraulic structures that play a crucial role in road and rail stream-crossings. Culverts are designed primarily to provide adequate hydraulic conveyance through the roadway's structural fill to prevent embankment overtopping. However, culverts are also structures with which many migratory and resident fish species interact with at various stages of their life cycle. It is widely known that culverts can act as barriers for aquatic organism migration and improving fish passage through culverts has been a topic of mounting interest over the past few decades. </p>
        <p></p>
        
<p class="main">
High velocity sections and shallow depths are well documented challenges to upstream fish migration. Culvert inlets can locally constrict channel widths, causing increased velocities over the culvert length. These velocities may surpass physiological swimming capacities of target fish species, inhibiting successful passage and ultimately blocking access to upstream habitat. Even at lower cross-sectional velocities, culverts of excessive length and especially those lacking appropriate resting areas, demand a protracted period of physical exertion from upstream migrants. In such cases, weaker species or juveniles from stronger swimming species may lack the stamina to complete ascent. Inadequate flow depth also impedes upstream fish passage by inhibiting adequate thrust from being developed from caudal fin movements. Fish failing their first ascent may eventually succeed, but likely only after incurring significant migratory delays and energetic costs - both factors reducing individual and population level reproductive health. </p>

<p class="main">
The practice of retrofitting aging corrugated steel culverts with smooth high-density polyethene pipes (HDPE), threatens to increase the number of culverts exhibiting impassable hydraulic conditions. The need to repair failing culverts in a timely and economic fashion, while limiting impact on traffic and freight routes, has increased the popularity of sliplining. The use of HDPE in slipline retrofits, is advantageous because the low hydraulic roughness of the plastic can in many circumstances (but not all) offset losses to discharge capacity caused by the reduction in available flow area. However, even at relatively low grades (e.g. < 1 %), supercritical flow conditions are prone to develop over hydraulically smooth HDPE material. In the transition from subcritical to supercritical conditions, depths reduce and average cross-sectional velocities increase considerably. Research effort towards developing fish passage solutions for HDPE retrofits is needed to mitigate impacts on the health of migratory riverine fish populations.</p>
<p class="main">
In recent decades, public awareness towards fish passage issues at culverts has increased. As a response, governmental bodies have strengthened regulations, often recommending or requiring land owners to provide measures to ensure adequate fish passage at stream-crossings. The addition of baffles is a popular measure to remedy the commonly suboptimal hydraulics for fish passage at impassable box, corrugated steel and slipline rehabilitated culverts. Baffles are simple prismatic objects patterned along the culvert's invert with the intent of adding hydraulic roughness, causing greater depths and reducing cross-sectional velocities. The benefits of decreasing velocities on improving fish passage through culverts is widely known.</p>
<p class="main">
Beyond fish passage considerations, baffles can pose risks to the culvert's discharge capacity; increasing Manning's <I>n</I> roughness values, reducing the available flow area, and amplifying risk of debris blockage. If the culvert's discharge capacity decreases severely, headwaters may overbank, placing public and private infrastructure at risk. Thus, baffle configurations must also be optimized to allow adequate discharge. Furthermore, baffled culverts increase the risk of sediment and debris deposition within the inter-baffle region. This has the potential to remove the benefits these low velocity resting zone may have for fish passage, while simultaneously affecting discharge capacity. </p>
    
<p class="main">
In recent decades, numerous baffle forms and spatial arrangements of baffles have been proposed and hydraulically characterized in the laboratory. Despite this attention, however, testing the impacts of baffle form on live fish passage while accounting for practical engineering considerations is still limited.</p>
