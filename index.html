    <h1> Welcome to my research site:</h1>

    <p class="main">
        I am currently a postdoctoral researcher with interests in fluid mechanics, open-channel flow, hydraulics, rivers, sediment transport and ecohydraulics. Topics such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), ecohydraulics (fish passage), experimental flow visualization techniques (sPIV, PTV), object tracking in 3-dimensions using computer vision, Python GUI application development to build research tools and Structure from Motion photogrammetry are what are currenty attracting my attention.

        Feel free to browse my new site (excuse the mess, it is still very much under construction) to get a better feel of my research interests and to learn what I am currently up to.
