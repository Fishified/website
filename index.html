        I am a postdoctoral researcher with interests in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), hydraulics, fluvial systems and eco-hydraulics (fish passage). My current research topic involves using eddy-resolved numerical models (in OpenFOAM) combined with aerial drone imagery techniques to investigate turbulent mixing processes at medium scale river confluences in the province of QC, Canada. Though this subject is the focus of my time, I am still active in eco-hydraulics, and have side projects involving experimental flow visualization techniques (sPIV, PTV), object tracking in 3-dimensions using computer vision, and building Python Qt driven GUI applications as research tools.

    Feel free to have a look around. I attempt to periodically update the blog with information I hope others will find useful and or interesting, usually on subjects pertaining to computational fluid dynamics.
