    <h1> Welcome to my research site:</h1>

    <p class="main">
        I am currently a postdoctoral researcher with interests in fluid mechanics, open-channel flow, hydraulics, rivers, sediment transport and ecohydraulics. Topics such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), ecohydraulics (fish passage), experimental flow visualization techniques (sPIV, PTV), object tracking in 3-dimensions using computer vision, Python GUI application development to build research tools and Structure from Motion photogrammetry are what are currenty attracting my attention.  
    </p>
    
    <p class="main">
        Feel free to browse my new site (excuse the mess, it is still very much under construction) to get a better feel of my research interests and to learn what I am currently up to.
