    <h2> Objectives:</h2>
    <p class="inset center"> 1. Answer the question: <i>Predict the efficiency of the sediment trap operating design conditions?</i></p>

    <p class="inset center"> 2. Investigate the response of suspended sediment concentrations over the range of expected flow rates through the river.</p>
    <p class="inset center"> 3. Determine the effect the water level of the lake downstream of the river has on suspended sediment concentrations.</p>        

    <h2> Publication details: </h2>
    <p class="inset center"> The results of this work were provided as an internal report to the collaborating company.</p>

    <p class="main">
    In this study a 2D hydrodynamic model (Telemac2D) was coupled with a sediment transport module (Sisyphe) to model suspended sediment fates over a 1.2 km stretch of a river located in Canada. The river flows past a number of residential residences before entering into a lake at its downstream end. The residents inhabiting the final 800 m stretch of the river upstream of the lake were experiencing difficulties navigating the numerous sediment bars composed of fine sediment that has deposited there over the years. A sediment trap was constructed in the bed of the river upstream of the residences in an attempt to decrease the quantity of sediment depositing over the navigable reach. However, sediment continues to deposit downstream and it is unclear whether this is an issue with the maintenance schedule of the trap or whether the range of hydrodynamic conditions the river experiences during a typical year are such that the trap cannot fullfil its designed role with 100% efficiency. </p>
    
    <p class="main">
    The work was performed in the context of an Engage Grant (program of the Natural Science and Engineering Council of Canada) between the principal investigator (Jay Lacey, Universite de Sherbrooke) and an industrial partner specializing in river engineering consulting. Our partner expressed an interest to assist them during the course of this project to deepen their knowledge of 2D depth averaged models to address a wider range of client engineering challenges.
    </p>

    <p class="main">
    Following model calibration, a large number of simulations were run, each investigating the response of the longitudinal suspended sediment concentration profiles (i.e., along the thalweg) to different combinations of flow rates and downstream water levels in the lake. Two bathymetries were modeled, one with the clean sediment trap in position and another with the trap simulated as being full of sediment. The results of the study and the numerical model that was developed over the course project helped our collaborator investigate numerous scenarios and propose solutions to their client.

        Video caption: Profile views of juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) navigating a bed-mounted bar (1st video) and the same bar with sediment obstructing the recirculation zone it the bar's lee (2nd video). The third video shows the reconstructed 3D trajectory of the fish in the 1st video. Average cross-sectional velocity in flume is 0.75 m/s, however just above the baffle it can be in excess of 1.2 m/s. Video was taken at 300 Hz and therefore the fish swims much faster in real-time.
